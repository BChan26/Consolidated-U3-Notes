# PERN Starter file structer

This repo includes a server folder and client folder. Each with its own package.json.

In the client folder, you can run `npm i` to install necessary dependencies for a react app. 

In the server folder, you can run `npm i` to install necessary dependencies for Express, Sequelize, CORS, morgan, and nodemon. I already added the nodemon scripts to the package.json file.

Before starting you may also need to update server/config/config.json with your username, password, and database name.
